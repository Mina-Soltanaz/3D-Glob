# India 3D Global Map


The idea came to us during one of our Tech4Good projects. We noticed that the Indian map which is freely available in global 3D repositories was incorrectly drawn. So we decided to get it corrected! 

The 3D global map has been deployed here [Link](https://www.thinkevolveconsulting.com/3d-corrected-map-of-india-and-the-globe/)

The files are being shared under the Apache 2.0 licence. We have bundled it with some JS wrappers so that its easy to visualize them in your projects.
